# C - argc, argv

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of command line arguments.

## Learning Objectives
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tasks

1. **1-args.c** - Program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
2. **2-args.c** - Program that prints all arguments it receives
