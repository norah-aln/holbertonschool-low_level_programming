# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and string manipulation functions.

## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Tasks

0. **0-memset.c** - Function that fills memory with a constant byte
1. **1-memcpy.c** - Function that copies memory area
2. **2-strchr.c** - Function that locates a character in a string
3. **3-strspn.c** - Function that gets the length of a prefix substring
4. **4-strpbrk.c** - Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes
5. **5-strstr.c** - Function that locates a substring
6. **7-print_chessboard.c** - Function that prints the chessboard
7. **8-print_diagsums.c** - Function that prints the sum of diagonals of a square matrix
