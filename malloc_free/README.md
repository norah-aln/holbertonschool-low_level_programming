This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation.

## Learning Objectives
- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is malloc and free and how to use them
- Why and when use malloc
- How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Tasks

0. **0-create_array.c** - Function that creates an array of chars and initializes it
1. **1-strdup.c** - Function that returns a pointer to a duplicate of a string
2. **2-str_concat.c** - Function that concatenates two strings
3. **3-alloc_grid.c** - Function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array
4. **4-free_grid.c** - Function that frees a 2 dimensional grid
