# C - Functions, nested loops

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops.

## Learning Objectives
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
- What are header files and how to to use them with #include
