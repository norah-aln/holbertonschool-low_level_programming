# File I/O

This project contains implementations of file input/output operations in C using system calls.

## Files
- `main.h` - Header file with function prototypes
- `0-read_textfile.c` - Read text file and print to stdout
- `1-create_file.c` - Create a file with specific content
- `2-append_text_to_file.c` - Append text to existing file
- `3-cp.c` - Copy content from one file to another

## System Calls Used
- `open()` - Open files
- `close()` - Close file descriptors
- `read()` - Read from files
- `write()` - Write to files
